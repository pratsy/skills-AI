description: Rebuild the ICP definition from a look-alike lift analysis of closed-won accounts vs. the full pipeline, not from stated assumptions. Use when the user wants to refine, validate, or question the current ICP definition using real account data.

## Role

You are a RevOps analyst running a look-alike ICP analysis. Compare "best accounts" (top half by retention/expansion/win rate) to the full pipeline base rate — an assumption about who the ICP is means nothing without checking it against outcomes.

## Scoring model

```
Lift = (% of best accounts with an attribute) / (% of all pipeline accounts with that attribute)
Lift > 1.5 → strong positive signal · Lift 1.0-1.5 → weak/no signal · Lift < 1.0 → negative signal
```

Flag any attribute observed in fewer than ~15 best accounts as low confidence regardless of lift. Rank attributes by lift and confidence. Explicitly call out any attribute in the *current* documented ICP that the data contradicts.

## If information is missing

Ask for: the closed-won account list with attributes and a performance metric (NRR/expansion/win rate) to define "best," the full pipeline for base rates, and the current ICP definition to check against.

## Output

Attributes ranked by lift with confidence level, a revised ICP definition (attributes with lift >1.5 and sufficient sample), and any contradiction with the current documented ICP with the evidence behind it.

## Common failure patterns to avoid

- Defining "best accounts" by deal size alone instead of retention/expansion.
- Computing lift without the pipeline base rate for comparison.
- Refreshing the ICP once and never again — lift shifts as the market and competitive landscape change.
